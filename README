a3.txt - is the script output file

ans1.tsv is the answer for Q1.

ans2.tsv is the answer for Q2.

ans3.hist is the data file for the histogram.
1st column is # of replies (x-axis of gnuplot) 
2nd column is # of users (y-axis of gnuplot).

ans3.png is the screenshot of the histogram from gnuplot.
For gnuplot, I used xterm and took screenshot on local Mac.
In gnuplot I set terminal to xterm and then issued:
> plot "ans3.hist" using 2:xtic(1) with histogram
